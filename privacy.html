            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>At Free Password Generator, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our password generation service.</p>

            <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>We want to be crystal clear about what we don't collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generated Passwords:</strong> We never see, collect, store, or transmit any passwords you generate</li>
                <li><strong>Password Configuration:</strong> We don't track or store your password settings or preferences</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We don't require or collect names, email addresses, or any personal data</li>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> No registration or account creation is required or offered</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Patterns:</strong> We don't track which passwords you generate or how you use them</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Our Service Works</h2>
            <p>Our password generator operates entirely within your web browser using client-side JavaScript technology. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All password generation happens on your device</li>
                <li>No data is sent to our servers or any third-party servers</li>
                <li>Your passwords exist only in your browser's memory</li>
                <li>When you close the browser tab, all generated passwords are permanently deleted</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Browser Storage</h2>
            <p>Our service may use your browser's local storage to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember your password generation preferences (optional)</li>
                <li>Store your password history temporarily (only in your browser, never on our servers)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party. You can clear this data at any time using your browser's settings or our "Clear History" button.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>Our website may use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Required for basic website functionality</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> To understand how visitors use our site (anonymized data only)</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> To display relevant advertisements through Google AdSense</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use cookies to track your password generation activity or store any password-related information.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <h3>Google AdSense</h3>

            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <p>We may use analytics services to understand website traffic and usage patterns. These services collect anonymized data such as:</p>

            <p>This data is aggregated and anonymized. It does not include any password-related information.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect or store your passwords or personal information, there is no data for us to secure on our servers. Your passwords are generated using cryptographically secure methods (Web Crypto API) and exist only in your browser's memory.</p>

            <p>Our service does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The service is available to all users without age verification or registration.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect personal information or password data, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete from our systems. However, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear your browser's local storage to remove any saved preferences</li>

            </ul>
